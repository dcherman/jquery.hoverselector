jquery.hoverselector
====================

Adds support for the pseudo :hover selector in browsers that support the matchesSelector function ( prefixed or not ).  The matrix of browsers that support this can be found at http://caniuse.com/matchesselector

It remains unsupported in other browsers since adding support would require using events to track what element(s) are currently hovered which has performance implications.
